# Mining-Slapfight

Mining Slapfight is designed for 2 players, as a hotseat multiplayer experience.

​​Controls: ​WASD or the arrow keys allow you to move your cursor around the map. Shift selects the object underneath the cursor and brings up actions you can perform with that object. You can back out of menus using control. Ending your turn can be done from any square that does not contain a unit with remaining movements. The main factory can produce workers, which create mines, and punchers, which can attack.

Developed for olc::CodeJam 2020, and my first attempt at a jam​! ​The code's a bit sloppy due to the time pressure.

Uses Allegro 5​.


Most assets were created by me (Dullstar). The one exception is the font, which is Allegro's built-in font.
