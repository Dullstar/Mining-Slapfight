# Mining-Slapfight

Mining Slapfight is designed for 2 players, as a hotseat multiplayer experience.

​​Controls: ​WASD or the arrow keys allow you to move your cursor around the map. Shift selects the object underneath the cursor and brings up actions you can perform with that object. You can back out of menus using control. Ending your turn can be done from any square that does not contain a unit with remaining movements. The main factory can produce workers, which create mines, and punchers, which can attack.

Developed for olc::CodeJam 2020, and my first attempt at a jam​! ​The code's a bit sloppy due to the time pressure.

Uses Allegro 5​.


Most assets were created by me (Dullstar). The one exception is the font, which is Allegro's built-in font.

This repository is a bit cluttered; I mostly grabbed all the files that were lying around and uploaded them, but I caught a few things that were left behind from earlier portions of the development process. For instance, very early builds experimented with olc::Pixel Game Engine (though I eventually swapped it for Allegro simply because I'm more familiar with it), and the header file for that was left behind despite not being used anywhere in the source code (I figured I'd mention that so it's clear why it appears in the history, but isn't credited anywhere). I wasn't planning on uploading the pyxel edit files for the assets either, but they're here now, so those can stay, I guess.
